## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region (TODO:)
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page (TODO:)
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

### Future improvements

- Better responsivity
- Filtering
- Better loading state
- Lazy loading (right now the front page loads all the countries for no reason)
